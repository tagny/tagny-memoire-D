  Abstract                 = {Data contamination and excessive correlations between regressors (multicollinearity) constitute a standard and major problem in econometrics. Two techniques enable solving these problems, in separate ways: the Gini regression for the former, and the PLS (partial least squares) regression for the latter. Gini-PLS regressions are proposed in order to treat extreme values and multicollinearity simultaneously.},
